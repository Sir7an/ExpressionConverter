# 🧮 Infix to Postfix Converter and Evaluator

This project is a simple desktop application that helps you convert infix mathematical expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) and evaluate them.

It’s especially useful for students or anyone who wants to understand how expression evaluation works in compilers and calculators.

## 💻 How It Works

1. **Enter an infix expression**  
   Example: `(A + B ^ C) * D + E ^ 5`

2. **Click "Convert to Postfix"**  
   It will show: `A B C ^ + D * E 5 ^ +`

3. **Enter the values of the variables**  
   Format: `A=5 B=2 C=1 D=3 E=4`

4. **Click "Evaluate Expression"**  
   The app will calculate the result and display it.
